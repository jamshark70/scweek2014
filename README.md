### Repository
This repository contains source material for a week-long tutorial workshop on audio synthesis and live control in SuperCollider, using primarily the Just-In-Time Library.

The workshop is planned for early March, in Shenyang, China.

### Sources
The text is written using org-mode <http://orgmode.org> markup syntax for LaTeX/Beamer export. Headers are included for presentation-mode export (PDFs to display on a projector during instruction) and beamerarticle export (same content in a relatively printer-friendly format, with indexed glossaries).

As it is a work in progress and depends on some custom emacs-lisp functions that are not yet published with these sources, it's unlikely that you will be able to render the documents at this time. As the project nears completion, I will probably clean all of that up and make sure the machine other than my own can render the PDFs.
