CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Create a new spherical coordinate with the given radius, rho, and angles in radians, theta and phi.


argument:: rho
radius

argument:: theta
azimuth angle

argument:: phi
elevation angle


INSTANCEMETHODS::

subsection:: Accessing

METHOD:: rho
Get or set the rho coordinate value.

METHOD:: theta
Get or set the theta coordinate value.

METHOD:: phi
Get or set the phi coordinate value.


subsection:: Testing

METHOD:: ==
Answers a Boolean whether the receiver equals the argument.

METHOD:: hash
Returns a hash value for the receiver.


subsection:: Math

method:: +, -, *, /
The math operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are accomplished by
first converting to cartesian coordinates, then answering to spherical coordinates.

METHOD:: scale
Scale the radius by some value.

METHOD:: rotate
Rotation about the origin in the XY plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: Positive values rotate from +X towards +Y

METHOD:: tilt
Rotation about the origin in the YZ plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: Positive values rotate from +Y towards +Z

METHOD:: tumble
Rotation about the origin in the XZ plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: Positive values rotate from +X towards +Z


METHOD:: rotateXY
Rotation about the origin in the XY plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: A synonym for rotate.

METHOD:: rotateYZ
Rotation about the origin in the YZ plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: A synonym for tilt.

METHOD:: rotateXZ
Rotation about the origin in the XZ plane by the angle given in radians.

discussion:: A synonym for tumble.

METHOD:: mirrorX
Mirror x, reflecting across the YZ plane.

METHOD:: mirrorY
Mirror y, reflecting across the XZ plane.

METHOD:: mirrorZ
Mirror z, reflecting across the XY plane.

METHOD:: mirrorO
Mirror across the origin.

METHOD:: neg
Rotate theta by pi and negate phi.

discussion:: This operation is equivalent to negating rho, and is a synonym for mirrorO.
