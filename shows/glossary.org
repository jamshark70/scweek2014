| aliasing               | In digital sampling, frequencies above the Nyquist frequency ``fold over'' and are heard as lower frequencies. This is ``aliasing''                                    |
| arguments              | Inputs to a function or method, provided at the time of calling it                                                                                                     |

|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array              | An ordered list of items with a fixed maximum number of items. When adding, be sure to reassign: \cd{array = array.add(item)} |
| ControlSpec        | Defines a numeric range, with low and high values, a curve, step size (for quantization) and a default value                  |
