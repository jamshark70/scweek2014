| Term               | Plural               | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AppClock           |                      | A permanent clock, which always ticks in seconds. It is lower-priority, thus, less likely to interfere with musical activity. Required for GUI actions             |
| Array              |                      | An ordered list of items with a fixed maximum number of items. When adding, be sure to reassign: \cd{array = array.add(item)}                                      |
| Association        |                      | An object that links an identifier (the ``key'') to another object (the ``value''). Dictionaries act like collections of Associations                              |
| Buffer             |                      | An object in the audio server that can hold large amounts of audio or other data. Used for sample playback and soundfile input/output                              |
| Clock              |                      | The general class of schedulers. Any actions scheduled at a given time will wait until that time to execute. See TempoClock, SystemClock and AppClock              |
| ControlSpec        |                      | Defines a numeric range, with low and high values, a curve, step size (for quantization) and a default value                                                       |
| DebugPbind         |                      | An extension class in the \emph{ddwPatterns} Quark, which prints every step of a Pbind's evaluation to the post window                                             |
| Dictionary         | Dictionaries         | An unordered set of associations \cd{key -> value}. \cd{dictionary[key]} returns the value for that key                                                            |
| Env                |                      | Defines an envelope specification, based on segments (target values, times and curves)                                                                             |
| Environment        |                      | A specialized type of IdentityDictionary, which you can enter (\ci{push} or \ci{use}). \ci{\textasciitilde envirVars} look in the current environment              |
| Event              |                      | Stores information like IdentityDictionary. Playing an event gets musical results: play a note, change values etc. Patterns can produce events for sequencing      |
| EventStreamPlayer  |                      | Gets Events from an event stream. It plays each one in turn, and then waits event's delta time before retrieving the next event                                    |
| File               |                      | Read and write text or binary files on the local filesystem                                                                                                        |
| FormantTable       |                      | An extension class (from sc3-plugins) listing filter parameters for different voice types and vowels                                                               |
| Function           |                      | A code block, with local variables and arguments, that can be executed at any time by calling ``value'' on it. A function always returns exactly one result object |
| IdentityDictionary | IdentityDictionaries | Like Dictionary, but restricts the types of keys for faster lookup. Usually the keys are Symbols                                                                   |
| IdentitySet        |                      | Like Set, but restricts the types of items for faster membership testing                                                                                           |
| List               |                      | An ordered list of items that can expand at will. No need to reassign: \cd{list.add(item)}                                                                         |

| OutputProxy        | OutputProxies        | One channel of a multichannel UGen. The SynthDef builder has to track connections to individual channels. OutputProxy is the individual connection                 |
| Pbind              |                      | An Event Pattern that collects values from child patterns under their names                                                                                        |

| Pdefn              |                      | Global storage for pattern proxies, where the patterns produce simple values                                                                                       |
| Pdelta             |                      | A filter pattern that accepts a sequence of time points, and returns deltas appropriate for the given bar length                                                   |
| Pdict              |                      | A Pattern that looks up subpatterns from a Dictionary, and embeds the subpatterns into the output stream in turn                                                   |

| Pkey               |                      | A pattern that reads a value from the given name from the event currently being processed. Child patterns can share information this way                           |

| Pseries            | Pseries              | A Pattern yielding an arithmetic series. Each value is the previous value plus a given step size                                                                   |

| Rest               |                      | Used in a Pbind's child pattern, a Rest object marks the event as a rest. The event will be produced and will take the time, but not make any sound                |
| Routine            |                      | Executes a Function. The function may \ci{yield} a value, and the next call into the routine will resume just after the yield                                      |

| SoundFile          |                      | Read and write audio files from the language (no server involvement). See \ci{Buffer} for reading and writing files in the server                                  |
| Stream             |                      | A category of classes representing sequences of values, of which \ci{Routine} is the most common. One value is returned by calling \ci{next} on the stream         |

| Symbol             |                      | Like a String, but ``atomic'': You can't manipulate the contents of a Symbol, only use it as an identifier                                                         |

| TempoClock         |                      | The clock normally used for musical sequencing. You can set its tempo, and have as many TempoClocks as you need, with different tempi                              |
| Wavetable          |                      | Very much like Signal, but it's data should be in wavetable format                                                                                                 |
| Pn                 |                      | A pattern that repeats a value or pattern /n/ times. If /n/ is \ci{inf}, it will repeat as many times as needed                                                    |
| Rect               |                      | Represent a rectangular area: \cd{Rect(left, top, width, height)}. Used for GUI object boundaries                                                                  |
