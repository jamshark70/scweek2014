| Term               | Plural               | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AppClock           |                      | A permanent clock, which always ticks in seconds. It is lower-priority, thus, less likely to interfere with musical activity. Required for GUI actions             |
| Array              |                      | An ordered list of items with a fixed maximum number of items. When adding, be sure to reassign: \cd{array = array.add(item)}                                      |
| Buffer             |                      | An object in the audio server that can hold large amounts of audio or other data. Used for sample playback and soundfile input/output                              |
| Clock              |                      | The general class of schedulers. Any actions scheduled at a given time will wait until that time to execute. See TempoClock, SystemClock and AppClock              |
| ControlSpec        |                      | Defines a numeric range, with low and high values, a curve, step size (for quantization) and a default value                                                       |
| Dictionary         | Dictionaries         | An unordered set of associations \cd{key -> value}. \cd{dictionary[key]} returns the value for that key                                                            |
| Env                |                      | Defines an envelope specification, based on segments (target values, times and curves)                                                                             |
| Event              |                      | Stores information like IdentityDictionary. Playing an event gets musical results: play a note, change values etc. Patterns can produce events for sequencing      |
| EventStreamPlayer  |                      | Gets Events from an event stream. It plays each one in turn, and then waits event's delta time before retrieving the next event                                    |
| File               |                      | Read and write text or binary files on the local filesystem                                                                                                        |
| Function           |                      | A code block, with local variables and arguments, that can be executed at any time by calling ``value'' on it. A function always returns exactly one result object |

| IdentitySet        |                      | Like Set, but restricts the types of items for faster membership testing                                                                                           |
| List               |                      | An ordered list of items that can expand at will. No need to reassign: \cd{list.add(item)}                                                                         |

| Routine            |                      | Executes a Function. The function may \ci{yield} a value, and the next call into the routine will resume just after the yield                                      |
| Set                |                      | An unordered collection of items, optimized for iteration and testing membership: \cd{set.do}, \cd{set.includes(item)}                                             |
