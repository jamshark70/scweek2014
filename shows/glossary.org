| aliasing               | In digital sampling, frequencies above the Nyquist frequency ``fold over'' and are heard as lower frequencies. This is ``aliasing''                                    |
| amplitude modulation   | Multiplying two signals together. If both signals' frequencies are in the range of human hearing, interesting things happen                                            |

|--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array              | An ordered list of items with a fixed maximum number of items. When adding, be sure to reassign: \cd{array = array.add(item)}                                 |
| ControlSpec        | Defines a numeric range, with low and high values, a curve, step size (for quantization) and a default value                                                  |

| String             | A list of characters that behaves like text                                                                                                                   |
| Symbol             | Like a String, but ``atomic'': You can't manipulate the contents of a Symbol, only use it as an identifier                                                    |
| Synth              | Represents a synthesis node on the server                                                                                                                     |

| perc       | \cd{Env.perc} makes a percussive envelope (quick attack, curved decay)                                                                                            |
| play       | Initiate a process that will run for some time into the future. Many kinds of objects know how to ``play'': Functions, Patterns, Events, Tasks etc                |
| push       | Set the given environment (including ProxySpace) to be current and active. Environment variables will then refer to that environment                              |
| rand       | \cd{num.rand}: Generate a random number $x$ where $0 \le x < num$                                                                                                 |

| release    | Tell a synth node on the server to fade out, according to the R segment of an ASR or ADSR envelope                                                                |
| rrand      | \cd{rrand(low, high)}: Generate a random number $x$ where $low \le x \le high$                                                                                    |
| set        | On a synth node or NodeProxy, set a new value for a control input: \cd{n.set(\textbackslash name, value...)}                                                      |
| setEvent   | Called on a ProxySpace, setEvent returns an event prepared to set controls within that ProxySpace                                                                 |
| sine       | \cd{Env.sine} makes an attack-decay envelope with sine-shaped segments. More or less a bell curve                                                                 |
| stop       | Stop a process that was previously started by ``play''                                                                                                            |
| value      | Evaluate an object. Usually this is the object itself. Functions evaluate themselves and return the result. Other kinds of objects do special things when value'd |
| wrap       | Constrain a number within a range. If the number goes above the upper boundary, it wraps around to the lower boundary                                             |
